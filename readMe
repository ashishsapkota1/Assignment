During this assignment, I have learnt different methods and tools. I have used Provider before for managing the states and wanted to use it for this project but at the very last moment I decided to use Bloc instead. This project provided me the oppurtunity to learn this statemanagement technique. And also I didn't know about the fold method in dart before but I got to learn about it from this. So, to sum up I have used Bloc for the statemanagement, FlutterToast for the toast message(toast is shown when the product item is added in the cart), and PageTransition package for the awesome transition of the pages(which I used for the first time in this project).
